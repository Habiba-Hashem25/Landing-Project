## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.


<!-- some modifications -->
a lot of things done there :
1- bulding the navBar by using createListItems() function , and looping over all sections by forEach to create the <li> and <a> tags

2-append all items to the listItems(navigation)

3-create stateOfClass() function to active the class 

4-declare the 'scroll' event to active the function (classList)

5-using the getBoundingClientRect() method to return the size of an element and its position relative to the viewport 

6-implement if loop to test the section is in the viewport or not :
    if the section is in the viewport >>> active the class
    if the section is not in the viewport >>> delete the active class

7-create scrollTo () Function ,and scrollIntoView to change the scrolling to be smooth
